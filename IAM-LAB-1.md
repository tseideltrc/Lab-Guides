AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

### Task 1: Create an IAM User Group

1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter *IAM*, and click the **IAM** result under **Services**.

2. From the IAM dashboard, click on **User groups** link in the sidebar menu.

3. Click on the **Create Group** blue button for creating a new IAM group.

4. In the **User group name** field, enter *DevOps* as the name of the group.

5. Skip down to the **Attach permissions policies** section, enter *AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess* into the search bar and select the resulting policy: **AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess**.

6. Click **Create Group**.
  * The **Groups** page now lists the new group and you are able to assign the **DevOps** group to any available user.

### Task 2: Create an IAM User

1. From the **Identity & Access Management** console, click on **Users** in the sidebar menu.

2. Click **Add user** to begin creating a new user.
  * Note: You can create up to 10 users at a time with usernames that don't exceed 64 characters.

3. Enter the following values in the form:
  * **User name**: *John* (Name must be case sensitive)
  * **Programmatic access**: Checked
  * **AWS Management Console access**: Checked
  * **Console password**: Autogenerated password
  * **Require password reset**: Unchecked

4. Click **Next: Permission** to advance to the next step.

5. Click **Next: Tags**. Skip this page and click on **Next: Review**.
  * You will add the user to the DevOps Group later.

6. Click **Create User**.

7. Click **Download .csv** for downloading a CSV file containing the security credentials and then click **Close**.

8. Review the newly-created user in the **IAM Console**.
  * You will now add John to the DevOps Group.

9. Click **User groups** > **DevOps** to open the DevOps group details view.

10. Click **Add Users**.

11. Check **John** and click **Add Users**.
  * Observe that John is now in the DevOps group.

### Task 3: Logging in using the new IAM credentials

After you have created IAM users and created passwords for them, users can sign in to the AWS Management Console by using a special URL, which has this format: *https://AWS-account-ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console*. In this lab step, you will get the opportunity to use a similar log-in link to log in to the newly-created IAM User.

1. From the **Identity & Access Management** console, click on **Users** in the sidebar menu.

2. Click **John** on the **IAM User** page.

3. Click **Security Credentials** and then navigate to the **Console sign-in link** listed in the tab.

4. Use the credentials in the CSV file you downloaded to log in as John.

5. From the AWS Management Console, click on **Services** at the top of the page and type *S3* into the text box. Select the **S3** option.

6. Notice that due to the restrictive permissions you placed on the IAM user "John", you receive an **Access Denied** message when attempting to access S3 resources.

7. Preserve the user John and the DevOps group in your account for the next Lab.
